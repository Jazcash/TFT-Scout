Green squares are your next possible opponents

## Installation

Overwolf does't support unofficial extensions, and to make this availabel on the overwolf app store, it would need to be vetted by Riot, so instead you have to install it as a development plugin:

Install Overwolf https://www.overwolf.com/apps/

Download the latest .opk file from https://github.com/Jazcash/TFT-Scout/releases

Open Overwolf settings (right click it in tray)

Open Development options

You know it's working when there's squares on the minimap. Sometimes the app stalls or fails to load automatically, reinstalling the extension usually fixes that. The tool is useless when there's 3 total players left in the game, will make sure they're hidden at this stage in a future version.
